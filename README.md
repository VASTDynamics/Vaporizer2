"PROBABLY THE MOST VERSATILE WAVETABLE SYNTHESIZER"  
Vaporizer2 is a hybrid wavetable additive / subtractive VST / AU / AAX / LV2 synthesizer / sampler workstation.  

The heart of this plugin is the alias-free versatile high-performance wavetable sound engine with low system CPU resource usage.  

Vaporizer2 comes with a groundbreaking wavetable editor with a vast number of editing possibilities including frequency shift, smooth, clean, bend and bloat for single-cycles, parts of single-cycles or even whole wavetables.
Featuring an easy-to use wavetable draw mode with smooth Bezier curves and snap to grid function.

Available formats: VST2 / VST3 / AU / AAX / LV2 plugins and a standalone version for macOS, Linux and Windows.

* Vaporizer2 was developed by VAST Dynamics GbR between 2017 and 2023 and is now free software under GPL3 license.  
* Vaporizer2 is based on the [JUCE framework](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) under GPL3 license.  
* Vaporizer2 ueses either [muFFT](https://github.com/Themaister/muFFT/tree/master) or [FFTW3](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3) under GPL2 license. Usage can be comtrolled with build parameters VAST_FFT_MUFFT or VAST_FFT_FFTW3.
* You need a (free) developer license from [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/de/developers/) to use the VST2 SDK (to build a .vst instead of .vst3).  In that case put the SDK in the VST_SDK folder.
* You need a (free) ASIO SDK 2.3 installation from [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/de/developers/). Place it in the asiosdk folder.  
* You need a (free) developer license from [Avid Technology](http://developer.avid.com/aax/) to use the AAX SDK (to build an AAX plugin for ProTools). In that case put the SDK in the AAX_SDK folder. The compiled AAXLibrary_x64.lib is expected here C:\Vaporizer2\AAX_SDK\aax-sdk-2-6-0\Libs\Release\AAXLibrary_x64.lib. You can change the folder in the global path settings of the Projucer.
* Code signing and notarization is required to build an AAX or an AU on MacOS. The process is not described here.
* To the best of our knowledge the true type fonts in [VASTvaporizer/Resources/Fonts/](VASTvaporizer/Resources/Fonts/) are freeware and can be distributed.

## Preparation for a CMAKE build (Projcuer .jucer file is distributed but not recommended)
Create a suitable local project folder and cd into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/VASTDynamics/Vaporizer2.git
cd Vaporizer2
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 1. Windows
```
build_win.bat
```
   
### 2. macOS
```
./build_macos.sh
```

### 3. Linux
```
./build_linux.sh
```

### System-wide JUCE installed
If you have JUCE installed system-wide than you can pass 
```
-DUSE_SYSTEM_JUCE=ON
```
 to cmake. If JUCE's cmake modules are placed in some non-standard directory add 
```
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/juce/cmake_dir
```

Prebuild packages and installers are also available [here on GitHub] (https://github.com/VASTDynamics/Vaporizer2/releases).

## Plug-in features
- Includes 780+ wavetables and single cycles and 450+ factory presets.
- State-of the art wavetable engine with four independent alias-free wavetable oscillator banks with up to 24 oscillator unison
- Can freely combine and modulate additive / FM / subtractive / wavetable / sampler sound generation types
- Vaporizer2 features a comprehensive preset management system with tags, free text search, file system folder management and ratings.
- Low system CPU resource usage - even with more than 1.000 oscillators playing
- All parameter knobs / sliders automatable and support manual editing for exact parameter values
- State of the art preset management system with tags, free text search, file system folder management and ratings
- Comes with a rapdily growing number of presets â€“ freely available on the website and GitHub
- Plus: the sound is stunning!
### Oscillators, polyphony, MPE and aftertouch
- Mono legato mode or polyphonic 4 / 16 / 32(!) voice modes
- Support for MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE): receive MPE MIDI dimensions (X/Y/Z) pitchbend, aftertouch (freely assignable), release velocity / lift (controlled via MSEG) and brightness / timbre (freely assignable) form supported controllers for highly expressive control options
- Intelligent polyphonic portamento / glissando (you need to hear it!)
- Support for polyphonic aftertouch
- Oscillator pitch modulation and phase modulation with very fast modulations (up to ~ 2kHz)
- Microtuning support (AnaMark Tuning files .TUN support)
### Wavetable engine
- Unique architecture allowing to freely change and even exchange / load wavetables while playing without aliasing
